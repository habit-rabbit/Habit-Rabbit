_Rabeet_, the Rabid Habit Rabbit, has has quite enough of your excuses. _Rabeet_ has died for your laziness, and now you need to ressurect her.

To make up for your years of wishy-washy flakiness, it's time to set (and acheive), some doggone goals!

## **SIGNING UP** ##
_Step 1._ Create a new user account with your email address and a password (securely encrypted using bcrpyt).

_Step 2._ Look at you go! You've all ready started accomplishing something (feels good, right?).

_Step 3._ You're logged in! Get your Pele boots on, it's time to smash some Goals!

## **GOALS** ##
_Step 1._ Create a new Goal for yourself. Think you don't need one? Think again. Think you don't have any? WRONG. Goals can be anything you'd like, but if you need some inspiration, some common goals are:

>Quit smoking. Quit drinking. Run 5/10/20+km. Learn a new song or instrument. Learn a new song on said instrument. Learn a new language. Get some excerise. Go for a hike. Learn to ride a bike. Learn to drive a car. Save some $cash monies$. Clean something. Build something. Make a difference in your life, your home, your community.

_Step 2._ You've chosen a Goal! Congrats! _Rabeet_ is very pleased with your progress. You can choose a deadline for the goal, or keep it open-ended. We recommend giving yourself a deadline, because you're more likely to work hard and acheive that goal. _coughLAZYcough_

_Step 3._ Your Goal can be accomplished in few-to-many Tasks, chosen by you. Each Task you complete gets you one step closer to achieving your overall Goal. (Goalverall.) We recommend breaking your Tasks into smaller chunks that you can accomplish easier!

_Step 4._ You can also make your Goal into a _*Challenge*_. A Challenge can be accepted by other Rabid Habitters (yes, that means you can accept other challenges), and the Challenger creates their own set of tasks for the Goal, if they choose.

## **SUCCESS** ##

Did you learn something?

Did you fix something?

Did you clean something (good grief I sure hope so)?

Did you build something?

Did you improve something somewhere, just for a moment?

**DID YOU FORGET THE INEVITABLE APOCOLYPSE AND FORBODING DOOM ON THE HORIZON, EVEN FOR A SECOND?**


Then our job here is done.
Thanks!
